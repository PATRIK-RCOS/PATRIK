Transmitter – HF 10m 

Considerations for possible input waveforms – work with Hisen to understand the current landscape. 

14.060 crystal oscillator as the base for a Variable Frequency Oscillator. -- very common, easy base frequency to shift 

Consider direct digital synthesizer – square wave input, will need to “soften up” 

28-29.7 MHz requirement (ham 10m band) 

To do:  

research the existing transmitter & power amplifier architectures 

Xiegu digital input architecture if I can find it, alt. Look for forum works (sdr/digital synthesizers) 

Research how the digital synthesizer input is filtered enough to not trigger horrible sideband by various SDRs 

Pixie Kit analog input architecture – needs to be modified to accept a higher wattage linear amplifier chip 

Research tuner interface –the current one I know off the top of my head is Xiegu’s, refer to next point for possible alternative standard interfaces. 

Look up ISO/IEC standards for these components. We may be able to use those as a guiding star.
