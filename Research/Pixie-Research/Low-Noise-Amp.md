# Low Noise Amplifier Research for Pixie Kit

## What Low Noise Amplifier Does:
- amplifies low power signals 
	- this is done without any huge impact on the SNR (signal to noise ratio)

- should consider the gain, RF input and noise when looking for a lna 

- high gain ==> weak signals get strong ==> high level signals ==> cause harmonics (not great)

- low noise is preferred

- lna can help prevent feed line loss by attaching a lna in-between the antenna and receiver 
	- lna's input = antenna & lna's output = receiver input
	- the lna's added gain with help make the loss less noticeable

- many categories of lna's 
	- (circuit) Common Source 
	- (circuit) Common Gate

	- (stage count) Single-Stage
	- (stage count) Multi-Stage

	- Specific to a Frequency
	- Specific to be Low Power Devices
	- Specific conditions such as temperature
	- Specific Wide/Narrow Band
	- Specific for other uses
 
## Applying to the Pixie Kit:
- low noise amplifiers are not in Pixie Kits
