# Pixie Mixer
The type of mixer that the pixie kit uses is the S8050. It takes a local oscillator (quartz crystal) which is called a Colpitts local oscillator, then mixes this with the radio signal. The Colpitts oscillator uses 2 capacitors that charge and discharge to be able to create an oscillation. Interestingly, this mechanism is also used as an amplifier when the signal is being transmitted from the pixie kit as well.
