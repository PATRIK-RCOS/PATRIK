To-do list: 

Digital Signal Processing (DSP): The process begins with software that generates the baseband I/Q signals. These are digital data streams that represent the information to be transmitted. The DSP also performs filtering and shaping of the signal waveform. 

Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC): Two separate high-speed DACs convert the digital I and Q signals into analog waveforms. This is taken care of by the DDS. 

Low-Pass Filter (LPF): analog I/Q signals from the DDS/DAC need to pass through low-pass filters to remove unwanted spectral images and noise created during the digital conversion process. 

Quadrature Modulator/Mixer: A mixer combines the filtered analog I and Q baseband signals with a local oscillator (LO) signal. The LO signal is split into two, with one branch shifted by 90 degrees in phase to create the quadrature components. The mixers perform the "upconversion," translating the I and Q signals from baseband to the desired HF radio frequency. 

Driver Amplifier: The output of the mixer is a very low-power RF signal. A linear driver amplifier is used to boost the signal to a level sufficient to drive the final power amplifier (PA). 

Power Amplifier (PA): The PA is a high-power, linear amplifier that provides the final boost to the RF signal before transmission. It is the most critical component for transmitting with sufficient power, and its linearity is crucial for a clean signal. 

Directional Coupler (Optional): A directional coupler can be placed after the PA to measure the forward and reflected power. This information can be fed back to the DSP to calculate the transmitted power and standing wave ratio (SWR). 

Low-Pass Filter Bank: A set of selectable low-pass filters is used to suppress harmonics and other spurious emissions generated by the power amplifier. Different filters are used for different HF bands. 

Transmit/Receive (T/R) Switch: This component, often a relay, automatically switches the antenna connection between the transmitter output and the receiver front-end. It protects the sensitive receiver circuitry from the high-power transmit signal. 

Antenna Tuning Unit (ATU) and Antenna: The ATU matches the impedance of the radio to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the RF signal.
