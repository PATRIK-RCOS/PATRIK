# Explanation
## Balun Toroid
This is the toroid needed for removing the common mode currents from the wires. This is necessary to build the balun, and is therefore a necessary purchase for the project. This specific toroid has been used in DIY balun projects before, can handle 100 watts, and is physically and mechanically strong. This makes it perfect for our project, to make it both rugged and feasible for use.

## Balun Coax
This coax is chosen specifically because of the tiny bend radius it can endure before it breaks. With a toroid being relatively small, 2.4 inches in diameter, the coax must be able to wrap around the toroid to actually get rid of the common mode current on the wire. This coax is also relatively low-loss for its size. Even though it has a good amount of more loss than regular coaxial cable feed line for the HF bands, the length of the coax will be so short that the loss is very minimal.

## Connectors
The reason I chose to order these specific connectors (UHF, SO-259) was because these connectors are the most common in amateur radio, and are also very reliable for their usage. If we used different connectors, this would mean we would have to purchase new coaxial cable to connect it to the radio, or otherwise make the radio less accessible for people wanting to build it themselves. Another factor is that a lot of the coaxial cable we already have are already terminated in the corresponding male version of SO-259 (PL-259), thus we would not need to buy specialized coax for the project and minimize cost.
These connectors are also not crimp connectors, but rather connectors that require you to solder. This is because, for the balun usage, these wires will not be exposed to the outdoors. Rather, the coax wire going around the toroid in the balun will be in an enclosure (idelaly weatherproof). Thus, there is no need to heatshrink around the wire, and there is also no need to make it look pretty. Solder joints are also more reliable, as it's a physical metal-to-metal connection, rather than kept on with force.
These connectors will also make it easier for us to use for prototyping, as we can solder individual wires onto the connectors themselves and connect them to a breadboard, or wire terminals.

## Antenna Wire
As said in the research, this is 16 gauge speaker wire that is perfect for the project. Speaker wire allows us to double the amount of wire given, since in 100 feet of speaker wire, there are two wires, meaning 200 feet in total. This is also perfect for a center-fed dipole, as both ends of the dipole *ideally* should be the exact same length of wire. This would allow us to cut the speaker wire at the length we need for one end, then separate both ends and the antenna is perfectly cut.
I've also put a link to 100 feet of speaker wire, as the cost between 50 feet and 100 feet of speaker wire was fairly cheap, and we have lots of room to not only recreate the antenna if we encountered any issues/wire got damaged, but we could also use this exact wire, and the excess that we will have, to experiment with new antenna designs, or have spare wire for the actual prototyping.

## Coax
This was an optional purchase link that was given to ensure we can connect the antenna to the radio itself. We would have needed two, as to connect the antenna to the balun, and from the balun to the radio itself. 
This purchase was optional (and we didn't end up getting it) because we already have access to lots of coaxial cable that we can use for the project, that's already terminated and ready to use. This was just to compile a list of everything needed if anyone wanted to recreate the project themselves.
