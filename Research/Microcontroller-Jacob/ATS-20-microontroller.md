# Microcontroller Model
Arduino Nano v3
* ATmega328 microcontroller chip

# Microcontroller Specs
| Type   | Detail |
| ------ | ------ |
| I/O    | 14 pin |
| Flash  | 32 KB  |
| EEPROM | 1KB    |
| Clock  | 16MHz  |

# Notes
* EEPROM is used for non-code non-volatile memory
* 16MHz is suitable for a semi-static text based interface but in no way can handle graphics
