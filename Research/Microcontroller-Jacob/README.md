# Microcontroller Research
## Microcontroller Family Research:
* [Research Notes (TODO)]
* [Decision Matrix](Microcontroller_Family_Chart.pdf)
#### Decision: [<ins>**STM32H7 Family**</ins>](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32h7-series.html)
  
## Microcontroller DevKit Research:
* [Research Notes](Microcontroller_DevKit.md)
#### Decision: [<ins>**STM32H745ZI**</ins>](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32h745zi.html)


# Todo:
* Research how to implement a DDS (direct digital synthesis) module with the STM32
* Implement a basic UI system with the controller Alex will eventually give
* Find something that I personally like with the pixie kit
