---

## Oscillator and Frequency Synthesis (Critical Section)

### Crystal Reference Oscillator

**Reference Crystal:**
- Frequency: 26.000 MHz (standard for UV-5R)
- Type: Fundamental mode, parallel resonant
- Load capacitance: Typically 10-20 pF
- Accuracy: ±2.5 ppm typical for proper FM operation
- Temperature stability: Critical for frequency accuracy

**Crystal Oscillator Circuit (Inside RDA1846S):**
```
    VDD_XTAL
        |
       R_bias
        |
    XTAL_IN --[XTAL]-- XTAL_OUT
        |                  |
       C_L1              C_L2
        |                  |
       GND               GND
```

**Oscillator Characteristics:**
- Type: Pierce oscillator topology
- Operating Level: <100 µW (low power to minimize phase noise)
- Start-up time: <10 ms typical
- Phase noise: <-140 dBc/Hz @ 10 kHz offset (specification)

**Reference Oscillator Harmonics:**
- The 26 MHz reference oscillator generates harmonics
- Commonly heard on: 78.0, 156.0, 416.0, 442.0, 468.0, 494.0 MHz
- These are spurious responses (3×, 6×, 16×, 17×, 18×, 19× of 26 MHz)
- Can cause interference or unexpected reception
- Varies by individual unit

**Why Crystal Accuracy Matters:**
- FM deviation accuracy depends on reference
- Channel spacing accuracy (12.5 kHz or 25 kHz)
- Example: 2.5 ppm error at 146 MHz = 365 Hz frequency error
- Acceptable for FM, but noticeable as "off frequency"

## PLL Frequency Synthesizer

### Fractional-N PLL Architecture

The RDA1846S uses a **Fractional-N Phase-Locked Loop** to generate all required local oscillator frequencies.

**Block Diagram:**
```
Crystal Ref (12.288 MHz)
    |
    +-- Reference Divider (/R)
              |
              +-- Phase Detector
              |        |
              |    Loop Filter (External R, C)
              |        |
              +-- VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator)
                      |
                      +-- Output to Mixer
                      |
                      +-- Programmable Divider (/N.F)
```

**PLL Components:**

1. **Reference Divider (/R):**
   - Divides crystal frequency to comparison frequency
   - Typical: 12.288 MHz → 8 kHz or 12.5 kHz
   - Determines channel spacing

2. **Phase Detector:**
   - Type: Phase-Frequency Detector (PFD)
   - Compares reference phase with divided VCO phase
   - Outputs error signal to loop filter

3. **Loop Filter:**
   - External passive components (R, C)
   - 3rd order typically
   - Sets loop bandwidth (~5-10 kHz typical)
   - Critical for phase noise, settling time, and spurious response

4. **VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator):**
   - Integrated LC oscillator
   - VHF VCO: ~290-350 MHz range
   - UHF VCO: ~800-1040 MHz range
   - Tuning voltage: 0.5-2.5V typical
   - Phase noise: ~-100 dBc/Hz @ 10 kHz offset

5. **Fractional-N Divider:**
   - Division ratio: N.F (integer + fractional part)
   - Resolution: Can achieve 1 kHz or better steps
   - Sigma-delta modulator for fractional division
   - Reduces fractional spurs

### Frequency Planning

**VHF Band (144-148 MHz) Example:**

For RX frequency of 146.520 MHz:

**1st IF:** 49.95 MHz (intermediate frequency)

**1st LO Calculation:**
- Target RF: 146.520 MHz
- IF: 49.95 MHz
- LO can be: RF + IF = 196.47 MHz (high-side injection)
  OR: RF - IF = 96.57 MHz (low-side injection)
- UV-5R uses high-side: **LO = 196.47 MHz**

**VCO Frequency:**
- VCO runs at ~290-350 MHz
- For 196.47 MHz LO: VCO = 196.47 × 2 = **392.94 MHz**
- VCO output is divided by 2 to generate LO

**PLL Programming:**
- Reference: 26.000 MHz / R = 12.5 kHz (channel spacing)
- R divider: 2080
- N = VCO freq / channel spacing
- N = 392.94 MHz / 12.5 kHz = **31,435.2**
- Fractional-N PLL programs: N = 31435, F = 0.2

**UHF Band (420-450 MHz) Example:**

For RX frequency of 446.000 MHz:

**1st IF:** 49.95 MHz

**1st LO:**
- High-side injection: 446.000 + 49.95 = **495.95 MHz**

**VCO:**
- VCO = 495.95 × 2 = **991.90 MHz**
- Within UHF VCO range (800-1040 MHz)

---

### Loop Filter Design

**External Components:**

```
PLL Charge Pump -- R1 -- C1 -- Vtune (to VCO)
                         |
                        C2
                         |
                        GND
                         
        Optional: R2 in series with C2
```

**Typical Values (from UV-5R schematic):**
- R1: 10 kΩ
- C1: 10 nF
- C2: 100 nF
- R2: 1 kΩ (if present)

**Loop Dynamics:**

**Loop Bandwidth:** ~5-10 kHz
- Too narrow: Slow settling, poor frequency stability
- Too wide: More phase noise from VCO, more spurious

**Damping Factor:** ζ ≈ 0.7 (critically damped)
- Prevents ringing when changing frequency
- Fast settling without overshoot

**Settling Time:** <5 ms typical
- Time to lock onto new frequency after channel change
- Important for scanning speed

---

### Phase Noise Considerations

**Phase Noise Sources:**

1. **Crystal Oscillator:** -140 dBc/Hz @ 10 kHz
2. **PLL Multiplication:** Adds 20·log(N) dB
   - For N=31,435: adds ~90 dB
   - Result: ~-50 dBc/Hz (within loop bandwidth)
3. **VCO:** -100 dBc/Hz @ 10 kHz (dominates outside loop BW)
4. **Fractional Spurs:** From sigma-delta modulation

**Impact on Performance:**
- Reciprocal mixing (strong signals degrading weak signals)
- Blocking dynamic range
- Adjacent channel selectivity
- Transmitter spectral purity

**UV-5R Weakness:**
- Phase noise performance is mediocre
- Cheap loop filter components
- No post-VCO filtering
- Results in poor strong-signal performance

## Receiver Architecture

### Double-Conversion Superheterodyne

**Signal Path:**

```
Antenna → RF Filter → LNA → 1st Mixer → 1st IF Filter (49.95 MHz)
                              ↑
                          1st LO (PLL)
                              
1st IF → IF Amp → 2nd Mixer → 2nd IF Filter (450 kHz) → Demod
                      ↑
                  2nd LO (49.5 MHz fixed)
```

### First Conversion

**1st Mixer:**
- Type: Active mixer (Gilbert cell)
- Integrated in RDA1846S
- RF Input: 136-174 MHz or 400-520 MHz
- LO Input: From PLL synthesizer
- IF Output: 49.95 MHz
- Conversion Gain: ~10 dB
- LO Drive: ~0 dBm

**1st IF Filter:**
- Type: Ceramic filter (external to IC)
- Center Frequency: 49.95 MHz
- Bandwidth: ~15 kHz (-3dB) for NFM, ~35 kHz for WFM
- Shape Factor: Poor (~2:1 at -6dB/-60dB)
- Rejection: ~40 dB @ ±30 kHz

**Why 49.95 MHz IF?**
- Standard IF for land mobile radio
- Good ceramic filters available
- High enough to avoid image frequency issues
- Low enough for good noise figure

---

### Image Frequency Problem

**Image Calculation:**

For VHF (146.52 MHz):
- RF: 146.52 MHz
- LO: 196.47 MHz (high-side)
- IF: 49.95 MHz
- **Image:** LO + IF = 196.47 + 49.95 = **246.42 MHz**

Image is 100 MHz away - easily filtered by front-end.

For UHF (446.00 MHz):
- RF: 446.00 MHz
- LO: 495.95 MHz
- IF: 49.95 MHz
- **Image:** 495.95 + 49.95 = **545.90 MHz**

Image is ~100 MHz away - front-end filter provides rejection.

**Front-End Filtering:**
- VHF: 136-174 MHz bandpass
- UHF: 400-520 MHz bandpass
- Rejection at image: >30 dB typical (inadequate for strong signals)

**UV-5R Weakness:**
- Front-end filters are minimal (cost reduction)
- Image rejection often <40 dB
- Strong out-of-band signals can cause interference

---

### Second Conversion

**2nd Local Oscillator:**
- Frequency: 49.5 MHz (fixed)
- Type: Crystal oscillator or derived from reference
- Not synthesized - always same frequency
- Very stable (no tuning needed)

**2nd Mixer:**
- IF Input: 49.95 MHz
- LO Input: 49.5 MHz
- Output: 49.95 - 49.5 = **450 kHz** (2nd IF)
- Type: Active mixer, integrated

**2nd IF Filter:**
- Center: 450 kHz
- Bandwidth: 12.5 kHz (NFM) or 25 kHz (WFM)
- Type: Ceramic or SAW filter (integrated)
- Provides main selectivity

**Why Second Conversion?**
- 450 kHz is low enough for narrow filtering
- Easier to implement selectivity at low IF
- Good image rejection at 2nd conversion
- Standard for FM receivers

---

### FM Demodulator

**Type:** Quadrature detector (integrated)

**Principle:**
- Uses phase shift of IF signal
- Converts frequency deviation to voltage
- Output is baseband audio (300 Hz - 3 kHz)

**De-emphasis:**
- Standard: 750 µs or 300 µs
- Rolls off high frequencies
- Compensates for pre-emphasis at transmitter

**CTCSS/DCS Decoder:**
- Detects sub-audible tones (67-254 Hz)
- Used for selective calling / squelch
- Integrated digital decoder

---

## Transmitter Architecture

### Direct Upconversion

**Signal Path:**

```
Audio In → Pre-emphasis → Modulator → Upconvert Mixer → PA → LPF → Antenna
                                           ↑
                                       TX VCO (PLL)
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple architecture
- No IF stages needed
- Direct modulation of VCO

**Disadvantage:**
- VCO phase noise becomes FM noise
- Modulation accuracy depends on VCO linearity

---

### Frequency Modulation

**Modulation Method:** Direct VCO modulation

**Process:**
1. Audio signal pre-emphasized (high frequencies boosted)
2. Audio controls varactor diode in VCO
3. VCO frequency changes with audio
4. Deviation: ±5 kHz (NFM) or ±12.5 kHz (WFM)

**Pre-emphasis:**
- Time constant: 750 µs (standard for land mobile)
- Boost: +6 dB per octave above ~212 Hz
- Improves SNR for voice
- Compensated by de-emphasis at receiver

**Modulation Accuracy:**
- Depends on VCO linearity
- Varactor diode capacitance vs. voltage curve
- PLL loop compensates for drift
- But fast audio changes are direct VCO FM

---

### TX VCO and PLL

**TX VCO Operation:**

Unlike receive, the TX VCO must be modulated while phase-locked.

**Configuration:**
- PLL sets center frequency (channel frequency)
- Audio modulation applied to VCO tuning voltage
- Loop filter bandwidth (~5 kHz) blocks audio modulation
- Audio >10 kHz: Direct VCO modulation (not corrected by PLL)
- Audio <1 kHz: PLL tries to correct (reduced deviation)

**Why Loop BW Matters:**
- Too wide: PLL "fights" the audio modulation
- Too narrow: Slow frequency changes, drift
- Optimum: ~5-10 kHz (below audio band)

**Result:**
- Low-frequency audio (<1 kHz): Reduced deviation
- Mid-frequency audio (1-3 kHz): Full deviation
- Some designs add compensation for flat response

---

### Power Amplifier

**PA Architecture:**

```
RDA1846S Output (~10 mW) → Driver Stage → Final PA → LPF → Antenna
                                             |
                                         PA Supply (3.7-4.2V)
```

**Driver Stage:**
- IC: Often uses SC1933 or similar RF transistor
- Class C operation
- Input: ~10 mW
- Output: ~100 mW
- Provides isolation and gain

**Final PA:**
- IC: Often uses RA16H1317M or similar
- Class C (efficient but nonlinear - OK for FM)
- Input: ~100 mW
- Output: 4W (high power) or 1W (low power)
- Efficiency: ~40-50% typical
- Heatsinking: Metal shield acts as heatsink

**Power Control:**
- Varies supply voltage to PA
- High: 3.7-4.2V (4W output)
- Low: ~2.5V (1W output)
- Simple but affects harmonics

---

### Output Filter (LPF)

**Critical for Spurious Emissions:**

**VHF Band (144-148 MHz):**
- Type: 5th order Chebyshev or elliptic
- Cutoff: ~180 MHz
- 2nd harmonic (290 MHz): Need >40 dB rejection
- 3rd harmonic (440 MHz): Need >50 dB rejection

**UHF Band (420-450 MHz):**
- Type: 5th order
- Cutoff: ~480 MHz
- 2nd harmonic (840-900 MHz): Need >40 dB rejection

**UV-5R Problem:**
- Filters are minimal (cost cutting)
- Harmonic rejection often inadequate
- 2nd harmonic sometimes <30 dB down
- Causes interference to other services
- Major reason for UV-5R's bad reputation

**Component Quality:**
- Uses chip inductors (cheaper)
- Tolerance: ±10% typical
- Results in filter detuning
- Performance varies radio to radio

---

## Antenna Switching

**Switch Type:** PIN diodes or integrated switch

**Configuration:**
```
        VHF/UHF Select
             |
    +--------+--------+
    |                 |
  VHF Path         UHF Path
    |                 |
    +--- TX/RX ---+   +--- TX/RX ---+
         Switch   |        Switch   |
                  |                 |
              Common Antenna
```

**TX/RX Switching:**
- Controlled by PTT (Push-To-Talk)
- Switches within ~10 ms
- Isolates receiver during TX (prevents damage)
- Isolates transmitter during RX (reduces noise)

**Isolation:**
- TX to RX: ~30 dB typical
- Not perfect: RX frontend can still be overloaded
- Some designs mute receiver during TX

**Loss:**
- Insertion loss: 0.5-1 dB typical
- Affects both TX power output and RX sensitivity
