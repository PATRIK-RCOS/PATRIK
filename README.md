# PATRIK

PATRIK (Portable Amateur Two-way RadIo Kit) is a development kit meant to make HF radios more accessible and affordable for new ham radio operators, as well as encourage competition and innovation through bringing open source to amateur radio. Additionally, it will be documented such that anybody can learn how an HF radio works, as well as the principles behind the design of one.
